## General info

As a kid growing up in the 90s, we've all wondered about this; catching Pokémon, battling in gyms, and using that cool Pokédex to give us the information we need. Obviously, there are no Pokémon in real life, but that doesn't mean we can remind all Pokémons due to this project.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- SASS/CSS
- React/Redux
- JavaScript (ES6)
- npm

## Setup

> To run this project, install it locally using npm

### Development server (compiles and hot-reloads)

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run start
```

> In the second terminal you need to write and run the command.

```bash
# there is access to data and serve Pokémon API at localhost:4000 thanks to this the application will work
npm run json:server
```

### Production server setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# build for production with minification in the "build" directory

```
